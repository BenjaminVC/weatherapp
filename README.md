# weatherapp

<b>weatherapp</b> is a live application for the linux terminal that automatically updates and displays local weather information as it runs. This application uses latitudinal and longitudinal geographic coordinates to access relevant forecast data, provided by the NWS API.

weatherapp also allows for viewing <b>advanced forecast information</b>. 
To view advanced forecasts, from the weatherapp live-view, simply use the arrow-keys to navigate by hour (arrow-key left/right) and/or day (arrow-key up/down).
A system beep will indicate the beginning or end of the available advanced-forecast view.
To view the weatherapp controls, from the main-menu select option #2, or press F3 in live-view.

First time users will be prompted by the initial setup, and must give weatherapp permission to use location information in order to continue.  
After the initial setup, weatherapp will be ready to use, updating and displaying live forecast information from the linux terminal. 
Alternatively, the user may at anytime update live weather information by pressing F5 or selecting option #1 from the main-menu.

To remove the current configuration of weatherapp, from the main-menu select option #4.  After removing the current user-configuration file, 
the user will then be prompted to follow an initial setup.
